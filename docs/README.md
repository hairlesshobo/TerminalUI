# TerminalUI - Simple terminal widgets for C#

## Overview
This project is meant to provide a very simple Terminal "UI" for dotnet 
projects. There are no movable windows, no mouse support, etc. It really 
is meant to provide some useful "widgets" or "elements" that can be created 
and easily updated in-place. A great example of this is a `ProgressBar`. 
Once created, you have a handle to the `ProgressBar` and can easily 
updated. For example:

```csharp
// This will create a progress bar at the current cursor index (x and y) that 
// consumes the remaining terminal width. It will then set the percentage to 42%.
ProgressBar progressBar = new ProgressBar();
progressBar.UpdateProgress(0.42);
```

## Demo
Here you can see a screen grab of a few of these elements in use:
